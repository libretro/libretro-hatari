HATARI 1.7.0 libretro

Quick Install :

I) To build , you have to go to the build/ directory 
export somes variables to setup your SDK 
and type make "platform=XXX".

Ex for android :

> cd build
> export PATH=/opt/somewhere/andtoolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.4.3/bin:$PATH
> make "platform=android" 


II) To install , you have to put manually the lib in the retroarch system directory.

Ex for android :

> adb push libretro-hatari.so /mnt/sdcard/
> adb shell
  >> su
  >># cp /mnt/sdcard/libretro-hatari.so /data/data/org.retroarch/lib/

III) To configure , you have to :

1)  put a tos file ( rename it to "rom" , you can change it after in GUI or in hatari.cfg ) 
     in the HATARI CONFDIR directory ( specific to platform ) 

2 ) edit a file named hatari.cfg (see exemple file in cfg/ directory)
    to match your rompath,tospath,hdpath...
    and put it in the HATARI CONFDIR directory . 

The HATARI CONFDIR is specific to platform and is for now hardcoded to :

- /mnt/sdcard/ for android 
- /dev_hdd0/HOMEBREW/ST for ps3
- sd:/HOMEBREW/ST for wii
- current path ./ for linux & win platform.
